    //Lazy Loading
    //Advantages:
    //Initial load time much smaller than in the other approach
    //Less memory consumption than in the other approach
    //Disadvantages:
    //Delayed initialization might impact performance during unwanted moments
    //In some cases you need to handle lazily-initialized objects with a special care or you might end up with an exception
    //Eager Loading:
    //Advantages:
    //No delayed initialization related performance impacts
    //Disadvantages:
    //Long initial loading time
    //Loading too much unnecessary data might impact performance
